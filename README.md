# Stock application for e-commerce

This application is aimed at controlling stock in an online headphones store. It's the second part of a full stack project I did. I used Typescript to program with React, React Router Dom for the routes, React Icons as the icon library, React Toastify for popups, Tailwind CSS for styling, Node JS for the back end, Axios to consume the API, Zod for serialization. You can try this application <a href="https://admin-stock-template.vercel.app/login">here<a/>.

I used an API made by myself that can be found <a href="https://github.com/carolf32/users-API">here<a/> and the first part of the project, the application in user's point of view can be found <a href="https://github.com/carolf32/audio-ecommerce-template">here</a>.
